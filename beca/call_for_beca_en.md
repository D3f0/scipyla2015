## Philosophy

SciPy Latin America has a financial aid program, providing funds to help people (speakers, students, and attendees) attend SciPy Latin America 2015. Financial aid recipients have some part of their expenses paid for with the SciPy Latin America budÂ­get. We actively encourage people to apply for financial aid: we can't cover all expenses for everyone, we try our hardest to optimally allocate our budget for those people really need financial aid.
