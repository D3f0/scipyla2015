##From Brazil

###Flights

The best alternative: Fly to Foz do Iguacu, cross the border and take a bus from Puerto Iguazu to Posadas.

<http://www.decolar.com/> o <http://www.despegar.com.ar> to check flight costs.

There are several daily flights connecting Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro to Foz do Iguaçu, located about 300 km from the city of Posadas.

*Gol Linhas Aereas* (<http://voegol.com>), *Azul Linhas Aerea* 
(<http://voeazul.com>) and *TAM* (<http://tam.com.br>) are some of the airlines that operate those routes.

From the Airport of Foz do Iguaçu, you may take a local bus to the terminal of the city, and then take the international bus that crosses the border into Argentina. Note that international bus does not enter the premises of the terminal, but you have to take it on an adjacent side street.

There are two Argentine buses companies doing international service and usually operate from 7:00 AM to about 6 PM. The fare is around **U$S 3**.

Another option, due to the location of the airport of Foz do Iguaçu, is to take a bus or taxi from the airport to the bridgehead of Tancredo Neves International Bridge and wait there for the international bus (thus avoiding the delay of the way to the local terminal, in Foz do Iguaçu, located in downtown).

After crossing the border, international bus goes to the bus station in Puerto Iguazú, Misiones, Argentina. At the same place you can take a bus to middle distance to the city of Posadas, capital of the province, at an approximate cost of **U$S 18**. Depending on the company, the journey takes about 5 hours.

Please note that it is important to take the buses **EXPRESO** or
**DIRECTOS** since the other can take many more hours.

##How to get from Buenos Aires to Posadas


A very typical case is to arrive from other countries to Ezeiza International Airport. Once arrived in the country, if you want to go to Posadas by bus, you need to go to the **Retiro bus terminal**; and if you want to go by plane, you will need to go to **Jorge Newbery Airport (Aeroparque)**. In both cases, we recommend taking a bus of the company Tienda León (<http://www.tiendaleon.com/home/>), at a cost of **U$S 16** to go to Aeroparque or **U$S 7** to go to Retiro.

###Flights

The flights to Posadas depart from Jorge Newbery Airport (Aeroparque) at various times with an approximate cost of **U$S 146**.
