\section*{REF: Sponsorship Prospectus}

On behalf of the Scientific Organising Committee of the
\textbf{3rd Latinamerican Scientific Python Conference} we are pleased to
invite you to become sponsor of this important scientific event to be held in
the breathtaking city of Posadas, Misiones, Argentina, between the
20th al 22nd of May 2015 at the  University Gastón
Dachary\footnote{\url{http://www.ugd.edu.ar/}} and include in the
Apendix specific details of the characteristics of the meeting as
envisaged. \\

This scheduled event will include a plenary session and several
workshops and is designed to bring together researches, teachers and
students with professionals and entreupeneures of the Scientific
Computing Community. \\[0.2cm]

Based on previous events of similar scope in Argentina and Brazil we
expect approximately 200 participantes, mostly from countries in the
latinamerica. We have attracted distinguished speakers from Argentina
and abroad. For now we have \emph{pre-confirmation} of \textbf{JuanLuis Cano}
and \textbf{Kiko Correoso} authors of one of the most
subscribed scientific programming blogs in Spanish
Pybonacci\footnote{\url{http://pybonacci.org/}}.\\[0.2cm]

We also note that the Universidad Gastón Dachary,  in its capacity as
host institution for the meeting will affront costs that include the
Welcome Reception for the speakers and the general organising
committee a significant cost that is usually paid for by Public and
private institutions. For this reason we invite you to support us to
allow us to meet other costs, that include scholarship for selected
speaker, mostly students, and it is with much pleasure that we do so
since we wish to not only to have a successful meeting for this
university within Argentina but also for the much broader educational
community and with this we hope to forge partnerships between
different actors within the scientific computing communities.

Thanking you in advance we trust you will consider being included as
sponsor and look forwarded to hearing from you to discuss more
specific aspects of our third Scila meeting.\\[0.2cm]

\section*{Conference Structure}

    The focus of the conference is to promote scientific tools
    and community based projects based on the python
    language for potential use and development for both academia and
industry. The principle
    objectives include: Provide a forum for the use and development of
    scientific python for the scientific, educational and Engineering
    communities in Latinamerica.

    Show and revise the suit of tools available for the solution of
    frequently encountered scientific problems and more specific
    problems:
.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Showcase the suit of scientific libraries developed by the
global community.
    \item Combine education, engineering and scientific applications to reveal
    synergies for problem solving, advancement of human knowledge
    and quality of life using Python.
    \item Generate a framework to canvas meetings and foster forums
    to discuss educational projects, research projects and engineering
    projects with the python language.
  \end{itemize}

The organisation and execution of the conference will be carried out
by a committee of educators from the Informatics Department of the UGD
in collaboration with active members of the SciPy Latin American
communities.

The local Organising Community will include the following Educators:\\
\begin{itemize}[nolistsep]
    \item Ing. Juan B Cabral (Scipy LA)
    \item Ing. Roberto Suenaga, (UGD)
    \item MSc. Filipe Saraiva (Scipy LA)
\end{itemize}
